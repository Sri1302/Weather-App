# Weather-App

🌟 Weather☁️App 🌟:You can know min and max temperatures and also type of climate(like Rain,haze,cloudy ..) of different cities across the world using this app.

In this project I used "Open Weather Map" which contains data and information about weather conditions like(min&max temp and type of climate) of differnet cities across the world.

And I used Concepts like:
👉Fetch()
👉Template Literals
👉Promises ( Ayschronous Programming)
👉Event Listeners
👉Dom Manipulation .etc

It is very organised and easy to Understand.
